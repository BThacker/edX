0.  Max Colors = BMP: 16M GIF: 256 JPEG: 16M PNG: 256
1.  GIF supports animation
2.  In lossless compression, when uncompressed all bits are recovered. In lossy, when it is compressed it has certain
    parts of information permanently eliminated. 
3.  JPEG is lossy compressed
4.  The pointer to the file is removed and it is marked as free space, however not completely removed.
5.  Overwrite all the sectors with a DOD pattern, or physically destroy the hard drive platters.
6.  stdint.h declares a header of integer types having specified widths and defines a corresponding set of macros.
7.  To define exact integer width types
8.  BYTE = 1, DWORD = 4, LONG = 4, WORD = 2
9.  B and then M
10. Bisize is the number of bytes for a structure, bfsize is the entire image size
11. The bitmap would be a top down DIB
12. BMIColors
13. If you couldn't open or work with the file, maybe it's already locked or something similar
14. Because of the byte size
15. Because to be a valid bmp, you need to be 4 wide
16. Sets the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by the stream
17. Seeks the current stream
